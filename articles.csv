But questions remain over deep divisions in French society and the political class.', 'Teenagers as young as 13 clashed with police across the country as hundreds of public buildings were set alight, more than 5,000 cars were burned, 3,400 people arrested, scores of schools were damaged, 150 post offices attacked, more than 11,000 fires were started and 2,000 shops were looted, with an estimated €1bn damage to businesses. More than 800 police officers were injured and some of the poorest estates in the country woke up to find key buildings – from public libraries to community centres – reduced to ashes.', 'The president now faces several difficulties. First is a national image problem. Amid deep mistrust of politics, crises have piled up one after the other – from the ', 'gilet jaunes', ' anti-government protests of 2018 and 2019 to the millions of protesters who took to the streets this year against Macron raising the ', 'pension age', ' to 64. Macron’s diplomatic agenda has been affected: he had to return early from a Brussels summit and postpone a state visit to Germany, only months after he was unable to welcome Britain’s King Charles amid pensions strikes and protests.', 'Deep-rooted divisions in French politics now seem more entrenched than ever. Since Macron’s centrist grouping lost its overall ', 'majority', ' in parliament in the 2022 legislative elections, the government’s ability to pass legislation has been limited as it struggles to convince allies on the right.

Some joined Macron in his calls for parents to better control their teenagers. But those on the left said there had been a failure to address segregation and “ghettoisation” of poor estates, where there was discrimination, inequality in education and a housing policy that concentrated poverty in “sink estates”. They said the last few years of urban renewal programmes – when millions were spent on demolition and rebuilding of certain tower blocks on estates – had failed to address deeper social issues.', 'A government official said Macron now wanted to “listen intently” to politicians on the ground and try to understand the many complex reasons for unrest before coming up with suggestions.', 'His immediate priority in the coming days is restoring what the government source called “lasting order” – more than 45,000 police officers a night have continued to patrol estates, which have not completely calmed. Macron deliberately did not declare a state of emergency like that of 2005 when the deaths of two young boys hiding from police in an electricity substation in Clichy-sous-Bois outside Paris triggered weeks of unrest on estates.', 'The question is what policy solutions Macron could offer for French housing estates. When he first took office in 2017 – and even before that, when he was economy minister – he had focused on entrepreneurship for the deprived outskirts of cities, saying he would liberalise the economy and end the persistent inequality that he said “imprisoned” people by their social origins.
